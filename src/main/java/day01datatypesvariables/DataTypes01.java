    //public: It means it can be used from entire project.(public Library)
    //        There is no any restriction to use it.
    //       "public" is one of the "access modifier"s

    // We have 4 access modifiers: 1)public  2)protected  3)default   4)private
    // default: It means it is open to a group. (Harvard University Library)
    //          If you make something "default" in JAva, it will be used just inside the package.
    //          To make something "default" in Java, do not type any access modifier.

    //protected: It means it is open to a group and their kids.(Gym is open to employees and their kids)


    //private: It means it is specific for a person.(Driving License)
    //         If you make something "private" you can use it just while you are in the class.
    //         When you go outside class it is impossible to use it.


    //When you create something in Java , you should name it.
    //How to name a class: 1) Start with upper cases
    //                     2) If you have multiple words, every word should start with uppercasses
    //                     3)Other characters should be in lower cases
    //                     4)You can use digits in naming



    //The part between "{" and "}" is called "Class Body"
